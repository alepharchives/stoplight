# Introduction

Stoplight is a distributed mutex server, based on the [Sigma algorithm](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69214/sigma_prdc05.pdf).

> Mutual exclusion: No two different clients are in their critical sections at the same time.

Features:

* progress guaranteed in the face of process crashes (i.e. lockout-freedom, will not deadlock)
* assumes asynchronous and unreliable communication 
* survives server and client memory loss
* endures messages being lost, duplicated or delivered out of order (non-FIFO)
* mutual exclusion guaranteed if `f<n/3` where `f` is the number of failed servers and `n` is the total number of servers.

# Install

## Prerequisites

* ruby / rubygems / rake
* `gem sources --add http://gems.github.com`
* `gem install auser-skelerl auser-dslify`

## Build

    cd stoplight
    rake

# Testing Locally

Open three windows:

window 1. 

    ./scripts/stoplight-server

window 2. 

    ./scripts/stoplight-client
    1> {Resp, Pid} = stoplight_client:lock(green, 1000).
    {crit,<6078.82.0>}

window 3. 

    ./scripts/start-client
    1> {Resp, Lob} = stoplight_client:lock(green).        
    {no,<6078.91.0>}

back to 2. 

    2> stoplight_client:release(Pid).
    ok

back to 3.  

    2> {Resp2, Lob2} = stoplight_client:lock(green).
    {crit,<6078.91.0>}
