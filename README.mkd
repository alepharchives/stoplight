# Introduction #

Stoplight is a distributed mutex server, based on the [Sigma algorithm](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69214/sigma_prdc05.pdf).

> Mutual exclusion: No two different clients are in their critical sections at the same time.

Features:

* progress guaranteed in the face of process crashes (i.e. lockout-freedom, will not deadlock)
* assumes asynchronous and unreliable communication 
* survives server and client memory loss
* endures messages being lost, duplicated or delivered out of order (non-FIFO)
* mutual exclusion guaranteed if `f<n/3` where `f` is the number of failed servers and `n` is the total number of servers.

# Install #
